ON REHEARING
McHaney, J.
Appellant, Amelia Long, wife of G. P. Long, petitions for a rehearing, and, as to her, we think it should be granted. We indicated in our original opinion that no judgment should have been rendered against her, but erroneously said the question of her liability was not raised in the lower court, or in the motion for a new trial. We are now convinced that it was raised in the trial and in the motion, and that the judgment as to her should be reversed and the cause dismissed, although counsel did not stress her individual non-liability. She did not sign the contract with appellee or his predecessor, and made no contract either orally or in writing for the sale of the farm with anyone. Her only interest therein was the right of homestead and her possibility of dower, all of which she released and relinquished in the conveyance to the Hudmans.
The judgment as to her will be reversed and the cause dismissed at the cost of appellee.
